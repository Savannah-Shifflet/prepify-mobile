## Description 
A mobile application that helps you track your adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis (or [PrEP](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/prep/index.html#:~:text=Pre%2Dexposure%20prophylaxis%20(or%20PrEP,use%20by%20at%20least%2074%25.) ), a medication taken to prevent getting HIV) using the evidence-based [on-demand method](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/prep/on-demand-prep.html). This event-driven method of taking PrEP is supported by the [World Health Organization](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/360861/9789240053694-eng.pdf?sequence=1). 

The 2-1-1 schedule has only been studied in MSM. There is no data and it is not recommended for use in cis-women, cis-men who have sex with women, transgender women and men, people who inject drugs, or people with active hepatitis B coinfection.

The PrEP 2-1-1 protocol with Truvada® is the only non-daily strategy with evidence for HIV prevention. PrEP 2-1-1 with Descovy® is not recommended outside of a clinical trial.

PrEP 2-1-1 should be prescribed by a healthcare provider and should include HIV and STI testing at least every 3 months.
